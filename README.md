# Memory-Storage
Website to store your precious memory in more visible way.

Website to store your precious memory more visibly.

I used to store many images with my family and friends on the computer and keep one backup version on Google Drive.\
This way has a lot of disadvantages:\
+ It takes a lot of time to find an image.\
+ Restoring all the files also takes a long time.\
+ Viewing images by clicking on each file is somehow boring.\

Besides, not only images, I also want to write down a detail about something that I created (why I make it, for who... etc), while I still remember, for example: small programs, handicraft toys...

So, I created this site, for easier storing, giving details and viewing your memories.
