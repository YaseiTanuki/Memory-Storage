# Memory-Storage
Website to store your precious memory.

Some time around 2021, I once want to have my onw website as my portfolio.
Sadly, lacking of time and knowledge, the project has been dropped.
In 7/2023, I restart it from scratch as this website and make it for everyone. Not only for them who want a portfolio but also for someone want a place to store things they do in the past.
